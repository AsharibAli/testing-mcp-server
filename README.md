# MCP Testing Server

This repository contains a testing implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by Anthropic to facilitate seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources or tools. MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**.

MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with tools, data sources, and other capabilities in a consistent manner, solving the "MxN" integration problem that arises when trying to connect multiple LLMs with various tools.

## MCP Architecture

The MCP ecosystem consists of three main components:

1. **Client**: The interface that allows users to interact with LLMs and MCP-enabled tools
2. **Server**: Provides specific functionalities, data access, or tools that LLMs can utilize
3. **Host**: The LLM service (like Claude) that processes inputs and generates outputs

### Key Components in MCP

- **Client-Server Architecture**: MCP uses a client-server model where LLM applications (hosts) connect to servers that provide context and capabilities.
- **JSON-RPC Messages**: Communication between clients and servers is based on JSON-RPC 2.0 messages, enabling stateful connections and capability negotiation.

### MCP Primitives

#### Server Primitives:
- **Prompts**: Templated messages or workflows
- **Resources**: Structured data for LLMs
- **Tools**: Executable functions for LLMs to perform actions

#### Client Primitives:
- **Roots**: Entry points for accessing client-side files
- **Sampling**: Allows servers to request completions from LLMs, enabling agentic behaviors

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a testing environment for implementing and experimenting with an MCP server. It allows developers to:

- Understand the MCP architecture
- Test MCP server functionalities
- Experiment with different tools and capabilities
- Develop custom MCP integrations

## Getting Started

(Detailed installation and setup instructions will be added as the project develops)
